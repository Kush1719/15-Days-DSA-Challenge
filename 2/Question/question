You have been given an arrayList 'Arr' consisting of 'N' integers. Your task is to find the majority element in the array. If there is no majority element present, print -1.
Note:
A majority element is an element that occurs more than floor('N/2') times int he array.

Sample Input 1:
2
5
2 3 9 2 2
4
8 5 1 9 
Sample Output 1:
2
-1

Explanation of Sample Output 1:
In test case 1, frequencies of occurrences of different elements are:

2 → 3 times
3 → 1 time
9 → 1 time

As 2 occurs more than floor(5/2) (i.e. floor(2.5) = 2) times, it is the majority element.

In test case 2, frequencies of occurrences of different elements are:

8 → 1 time
5 → 1 time
1 → 1 time
9 → 1 time

As no element occurs more than floor(4/2) = 2 times. Thus No majority element is present.
